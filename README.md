Introduction:

Shooter is a 2D game developed in C using the SDL2 library and raycasting techniques. Players navigate through a maze-like environment in a first-person perspective, encountering enemies and obstacles. The primary objective is to reach the exit while avoiding dangers and collecting power-ups.

Inspiration:

Growing up, I was fascinated by the immersive worlds created by video games. The thrill of exploration, the challenge of overcoming obstacles, and the satisfaction of achieving goals were experiences that captivated me. Games like Resident Evil and God of War ignited a passion within me to create my own virtual adventures.
Inspired by these early experiences, I embarked on the journey to develop Shooter. The project allowed me to explore the intricacies of game development, from the underlying programming concepts to the creative aspects of level design and character development.
